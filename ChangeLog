Some small fixes.

	- panel-plugin/history.c(clipman_history_add_text):
		Don't escape the text for markups as the preview is displayed
		as a label, and not as a markup.
	- panel-plugin/history.c(clipman_history_finalize):
		Clear the GSLists stored inside ClipmanHistory on finalize.
	- panel-plugin/menu.c(_clipman_menu_update_list):
		Set the clear history menu item sensitive/insensitive given the
		status of the history.  For that store a pointer of the menu
		item inside the private data.
	- panel-plugin/collector.c(cb_clipboard_owner_change):
		Make sure the image is not NULL before adding it to the history

Major rewrite of the plugin using GObjects and Xfconf.

	- The plugin now uses GObjects with properties binded to Xfconf for easy
	configuration.
	- The plugin is able to store texts and images.
	- The changes over the clipboards are noticed with signals and no more
	a timeout which saves a lot of CPU wakeups.

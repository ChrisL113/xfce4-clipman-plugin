Major rewrite of the plugin using GObjects and Xfconf.

	- The plugin now uses GObjects with properties binded to Xfconf for easy
	configuration.
	- The plugin is able to store texts and images.
	- The changes over the clipboards are noticed with signals and no more
	a timeout which saves a lot of CPU wakeups.

Forget to add support for GLib < 2.16 to save the actions.

	- panel-plugin/actions.c:
		I somehow was too hasty to commit, and forgot about support
		for GLib < 2.16 to save the actions to the XML file.

Fix g_debug().

	- Looks like I left some g_debug() calls in the code.

Actions are saved/loaded to/from an XML file.

	- panel-plugin/actions.c(clipman_actions_load):
		Load actions from an XML file from the user config directory
		or fallback to a system wide config directory.  Drop the
		hard-coded actions.
	- panel-plugin/actions.c(clipman_actions_save):
		Save the actions in an XML format inside the user config
		directory.
	- panel-plugin/actions.c(clipman_actions_add):
		Create the regex with the flag "anchored" to force the regex'
		with a starting ^ and an ending $.
	- panel-plugin/Makefile.am:
		Declare SYSCONFDIF and add XML actions file.
	- panel-plugin/xfce4-clipman-actions.xml:
	 	Default system wide configuration file of the actions.

Actions are available but hard-coded at this time.

	- configure.ac.in, tests/*:
		Add a test program for the actions.
	- panel-plugin/actions.c, panel-plugin/actions.h,
	panel-plugin/Makefile.am:
		A new GObject ClipmanActions with methods to add and remove
		commands for a specific regex.  The code to save and load from
		an XML file still needs to be written.
	- panel-plugin/collector.c, panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c:
		Install new property "enable-actions" which will match the
		clipboard texts for actions.  Bind the property to xfconf
		inside panel_plugin_register().
	- panel-plugin/collector.c(cb_clipboard_owner_change):
		Change timeout from 500 to 250 milliseconds to make the
		actions respond faster on a mouse release.
	- panel-plugin/settings-dialog.glade:
		New dialogs for the actions.

2009-01-15	Mike Massonnet
Some minor changes.

	- panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c(panel_plugin_configure),
	panel-plugin/settings-dialog.glade:
		The menu is blocked while the dialog is shown.  Set the dialog
		transient for the panel plugin toplevel window and destroy with
		the parent (this introduces a bug: the panel button remains
		unclickable but dunno why).
	- panel-plugin/collector.c(cb_check_primary_clipboard):
		Change the behavior of the "add-primary-selection" option to
		copy the text to the default clipboard, so that it now behaves
		like "what you select can be pasted".
	- panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c(panel_plugin_load,panel_plugin_save):
		Load/Save the images with the extension ".png".
	- panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c(panel_plugin_load,panel_plugin_save):
		Correct the size allocated to texts.  Fixes a free corruption!

2009-01-14	Mike Massonnet
The settings dialog is in.

	- configure.ac.in, panel-plugin/Makefile.am:
		Add Glade dependency for the settings dialog.
	- panel-plugin/common.h, panel-plugin/history.c,
	panel-plugin/collector.c:
		Declare define names for the default values, also rename the
		property ignore-primary-clipboard from ClipmanCollector to
		add-primary-clipboard to keep the easiness of Xfconf bindings
		inside the settings dialog.
	- panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c:
		Connect configure function from XfcePanelPlugin.
	- panel-plugin/settings-dialog.glade:
		The Glade interface of the settings dialog.

2009-01-13	Mike Massonnet
New property in ClipmanHistory "save-on-quit".

	- panel-plugin/history.c:
		Install new property "save-on-quit".
	- panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c:
		Bind property "save-on-quit" from ClipmanHistory to Xfconf and
		use it in plugin_panel_load() and plugin_panel_save().

2009-01-13	Mike Massonnet
Save the history on disk.

	- panel-plugin/history.c, panel-plugin/history.h:
		New function clipman_history_get_list() and drop the functions
		clipman_history_get_texts() and clipman_history_get_images().
	- panel-plugin/menu.c(_clipman_menu_update_list):
		Use the new function replacement from ClipmanHistory.
	- panel-plugin/panel-plugin.c:
		Implement new functions panel_plugin_load() and
		panel_plugin_save() to respectively load the history (images
		and texts) and save the history.

2009-01-09	Mike Massonnet
Some small fixes.

	- panel-plugin/history.c(clipman_history_add_text):
		Don't escape the text for markups as the preview is displayed
		as a label, and not as a markup.
	- panel-plugin/history.c(clipman_history_finalize):
		Clear the GSLists stored inside ClipmanHistory on finalize.
	- panel-plugin/menu.c(_clipman_menu_update_list):
		Set the clear history menu item sensitive/insensitive given the
		status of the history.  For that store a pointer of the menu
		item inside the private data.
	- panel-plugin/collector.c(cb_clipboard_owner_change):
		Make sure the image is not NULL before adding it to the history

2009-01-09	Mike Massonnet
Major rewrite of the plugin using GObjects and Xfconf.

	- The plugin now uses GObjects with properties binded to Xfconf for easy
	configuration.
	- The plugin is able to store texts and images.
	- The changes over the clipboards are noticed with signals and no more
	a timeout which saves a lot of CPU wakeups.

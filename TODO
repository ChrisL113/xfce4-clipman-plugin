Actions:
- Add support for GLib < 2.16 for the actions settings (the commands treeview)
- Set sensitivity of "ok" buttons in the actions settings dialogs
- Sanity check for action_name on "add action"
- Sanity check on the regex
- A regex validator dialog
Collector:
- I think I catched a crasher when the collector tries to restore but the history is empty
- Drop the restore code and push the clipboard data inside the plugin so it's the owner

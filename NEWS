Version 1.1.0 - 2009-07-xx

- Settings dialog is an external application xfce4-clipman-settings.  Optional
  support for libunique to make the settings dialog unique.
- Switched to GIO for file monitoring support over the actions XML file.
  Minimum version requirement for glib bumped to 2.16.
- The bundle "standalone app/panel plugin" is splitted in two binaries.
- The autostart behavior has changed. Now when the standalone application is
  launched the autostart file is automatically set to true, and when it is
  dropped by the user it is set to false.
- Added the daemon from gnome-settings-daemon, it keeps a copy of all targets
  and replicates them to the clipboard before it is going empty.
- Added groups into ClipmanActions identified by integers where -1 represents
  all the groups. This makes it possible to retrieve only a set of actions. The
  Clipman settings dialog has a new checkbox to retrieve actions only on manual
  copies (e.g. Ctrl+C).
- Fixed a bug with KDE where the status icon is getting smaller and smaller.

- Ported documentation to Mallard and moved it into the xfce4-docs repo.
- Add optional build-dependency against XTEST to be able to paste content as
  soon as it has been selected from the history. The setting is hidden under

  0 for deactivated, 1 to paste with Ctrl+V and 2 to paste with Shift+Ins.
- Add option "Reverse history order" inside the Settings dialog.
- Add hidden setting /tweaks/popup-at-pointer, works only when triggered
  through xfce4-popup-clipman.
- Anchor the Regex pattern within ^<pattern>$, before it was only anchored
  with ^<pattern>.
- New Regex dialog available within the Action dialog that appears upon a click
  on a button beneath the Action pattern to be able to test the Regex.
- New "Reset" button in the Actions tab of the Settings dialog to reset the
  actions with the one installed system-wide.

- Bug 6853: Port to libxfce4ui.
- Bug 6069 6119 6120: Fixed possible NULL values.

Version 1.1.3 - 2009-11-15

- Fix empty clipboard when leaving Firefox (bug #5738)

Version 1.1.2 - 2009-11-15

- Clipboard manager rewrote on top of GTK+ functions. It takes also the primary
  clipboard (mouse selections) into account.
- Fix popup command not always working from keyboard shortcut (#bug 5909).
- Update documentation.

Version 1.1.1 - 2009-09-30

- New option "Ignore selections" and dropped the option "Exclude from option"
  that was bound to the "Sync selections". Now it is always possible to keep
  the selections in the history (as it was the case in older version).
- Note about the regex nature in the actions dialog being always anchored.

Version 1.1.0 - 2009-09-03

- Settings dialog is an external application xfce4-clipman-settings.  Optional
  support for libunique to make the settings dialog unique.
- Switched to GIO for file monitoring support over the actions XML file.
  Minimum version requirement for glib bumped to 2.16.
- The bundle "standalone app/panel plugin" is splitted in two binaries.
- The autostart behavior has changed. Now when the standalone application is
  launched the autostart file is automatically set to true, and when it is
  dropped by the user it is set to false.
- Added the daemon from gnome-settings-daemon, it keeps a copy of all targets
  and replicates them to the clipboard before it is going empty.
- Added groups into ClipmanActions identified by integers where -1 represents
  all the groups. This makes it possible to retrieve only a set of actions. The
  Clipman settings dialog has a new checkbox to retrieve actions only on manual
  copies (e.g. Ctrl+C).
- Fixed a bug with KDE where the status icon is getting smaller and smaller.
